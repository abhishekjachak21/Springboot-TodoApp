- this is very simple project, which was made during practice of all the things involved in spring boot on date 08-06-2025.
✅ Spring Boot project setup
✅ MySQL connection
✅ REST APIs create kiye
✅ Full CRUD logic likha
✅ Errors ko fix kiya
✅ Debug karna seekha
✅ Aur sabse important: gained confidence at the end of project.

- flow imp hai
- Client Request --> Controller -> Service -> Repository -> Model -> Response view

- Repo file is Jpa only
- model is how your object will look like.
- start from model, from my experince its makes easy
- still i also want to implement JDBC into this, so that understanding increases.
